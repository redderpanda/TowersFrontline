Title: 
Towers Frontline

How To Play:
- Tap "Host" to host a match, or wait for another player to host and tap "Match" when it appears.
- Your current wealth appears in the top left-hand corner of your screen.
- Tap any of the toggles on the bottom of the screen to select which unit you want to spawn.
- You can only spawn a unit on terrain that you control (marked by your color).
- Spawning a unit will deduct a set amount of funds from your current wealth.
- If you pick a tower from the toggle list you must tap on a plot to spawn the selected tower (Economy towers give a nice boost to your income rate, while regular towers deal AOE damage to enemy units).
- The goal of the game is to take as many plots as you can, and to eventually take over the opponents base.
- Taking a plot grants you the terrain surrounding it, and the ability to place towers on it.

Known Bugs:
- Tapping too quickly on certain phones have resulted in the game crashing.
- Sometimes the matchmaking is finicky, and will show a match that doesn't exist (it's usually a previously hosted game that has yet to leave the queue of active matches). You can just restart the app to fix this usually.
